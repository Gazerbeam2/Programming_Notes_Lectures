Main properties of a algorithm

 - **Input**- An algorithm must possess 0 or more well-defined inputs supplied externally to the algorithm.
- **Output**- An algorithm should have 1 or more well-defined outputs as desired.
- **Correctness**- Every step of the algorithm must generate a correct output.
- **Definiteness**-Algorithms should be clear and unambiguous, thus every step of the algorithm should be clear and well defined.
- **Finiteness**- The algorithm should have a finite number of steps that must be carried out to achieve the task at hand.

An algorithm is just a function that transforms a certain input data structure into a certain output [[ Data Structures]]
